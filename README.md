# taxi-project

## The project originated from Stratascratch's data projects with link below

### Stratascratch Link: https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/nyc-taxi-data

### What I want to learn from this project is data visualization (both in communication and Tableau), basic statistics, Python, and diagnostic/predictive data analysis. To further my coding learnings, I first cleaned and analyzed in PostgreSQL and then do the same cleaning and analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

#### Firstly I have started by downloading the Jupyter Notebook extension in my vscode along with iPynb kernel extension needed to execute the code. I do this so I can decompress the bz2 file using pandas.
