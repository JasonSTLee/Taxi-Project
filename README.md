# Taxi Data Analysis

## The project's database and overall idea came from Stratascratch

### Stratascratch Link: https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/nyc-taxi-data
### NYC Data Dictionary: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-green?tabs=azureml-opendatasets

### What I want to learn from this project is data visualization with Tableau, SQL, and Python. 

#### I started by downloading the Jupyter Notebook extension in my vscode along with iPynb kernel extension needed to execute the code. I do this so I can decompress the bz2 file using pandas. The code is labeled 'file_converter.ipynb'. Once downloaded I'm able to import the csv into PostgreSQL to begin my analysis.

#### Under DA_Questions_SQL I have included 7 questions that are similar to the ones Stratascratch has provided with my own twist on it. Some unique functions that I learned along the way are: width_bucket(), corr(), zscore, and information.schema.

#### After analyzing the data in SQL I moved on to Tableau to visualize the data, link can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jason.lee2654/viz/Taxi_projectDistanceHistogram/final_dashboard
