# taxi-project

## This originally from Stratascratch's data projects and I have chosen to tackle this project because of the analysis and data visualization required in this project which will allow me to delve deeper into SQL and Tableau. I will also be learning the statistical concepts needed to answer the project's question. Lastly, the file is in bz2 type and I need to decompress using Python which I will be doing on vscode's Jupyter Notebook

### What I want to learn from this a further expansion of data visualization (both in communication and Tableau), basic statistics, Python, and diagnostic/predictive data analysis.

#### Firstly I have started by downloading the Jupyter Notebook extension in my vscode along with iPynb kernel extension needed to execute the code. I do this so I can decompress the bz2 file using pandas.
